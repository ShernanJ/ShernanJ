building systems that turn messy, real-world signals into structured knowledge.  
focused on abstraction, uncertainty, and systems humans and agents can reason over.


currently building + exploring:
- abstraction & ontology design
- data modeling under uncertainty
- browser execution & runtime interception
- client-side instrumentation
- observability and high-signal event extraction
- documentation infrastructure for agents (structured, cached, versioned)
- turning live signals into explanations humans and agents can use
