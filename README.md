building systems that turn messy, real-world signals into structured knowledge.  
focused on abstraction, uncertainty, and systems humans and agents can reason over.


currently building & exploring:
- ontology-driven data modeling & knowledge graphs
- agent-native documentation infrastructure
- browser execution & runtime interception
- high-signal client-side instrumentation
- large-scale crawling, enrichment, and evidence grounding
- scoring & explanation engines over real data
- creator economy intelligence (creatorgraph, creatorpulse)
- community operating infrastructure & interaction graphs
- turning live signals into explanations humans and agents can use
