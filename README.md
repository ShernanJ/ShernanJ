building projects around personal data, behavior, and systems design.  
focused on abstraction, data modeling under uncertainty, and reasoning over messy, real-world signals.

currently exploring:
- abstraction and ontology design
- data modeling under uncertainty
- browser execution and runtime interception
- client-side instrumentation and observability
- real-time signal correlation → human-readable reasoning
