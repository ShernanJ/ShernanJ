building projects around personal data, behavior, and systems design.  
focused on abstraction, data modeling under uncertainty, and reasoning over messy, real-world signals.

projects here start as questions, not products.

currently exploring:
- abstraction and ontology design
- data modeling under uncertainty
- system boundaries and tradeoffs
- browser execution and runtime models
- client-side instrumentation via cdp
