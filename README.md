building systems that turn messy, real-world signals into structured, usable knowledge.  
focused on abstraction, data modeling under uncertainty, and designing infrastructure
that both humans and agents can reason over.

currently building + exploring:
- abstraction & ontology design
- data modeling under uncertainty
- browser execution, runtime interception, and client-side instrumentation
- observability and high-signal event extraction
- real-time signal correlation → human-readable + agent-readable reasoning
- documentation infrastructure for agents (structured, cached, versioned)

interests:
- agents as software collaborators (not prompt toys)
- explainable systems over black-box intelligence
- developer infra that reduces cognitive + compute waste
